# Geo-Spatial-Data-Analysis


Apache Spark is an analytics platform used to process large amounts of data, supporting APIs for many common programming languages, such as Python, Java and Scala, as well as the ability to run SQL-like queries. It is thus well-suited to many large-scale modern analytics applications (Apache, Spark Overview).

Geospatial data analysis is a particularly data intensive domain due to the high dimensionality of the data (coordinates of a specific location, time, and other attributes) and rapid creation, whether from sensors taking measurements at specified time intervals, or data from mobile device applications. This scale makes Apache Spark a useful tool for processing such data.

In this project, I implement code using Scala and Apache Spark SQL to complete a geospatial hotspot analysis of taxi trips in New York City.
